webcast
=======

Demo application for webcasting based on webrtc. This first version will be based on backbone.js,
but in the future I want to evolve the demo to angular.js

I'm trying to combine the solutions adopted in the following projects : 

https://github.com/samdutton/simpl/tree/master/getusermedia
https://github.com/rwldrn/dmv
https://github.com/sdslabs/hackview


At first it will capture video on chrome desktop and opera mobile. ( For more information see Wiki roadmap ).
